# Issue With PDF Preview - Page Break Incorrect

This ticket was opened by the Middleware Team, supposedly by Namirah Anwar, which initiated a support ticket at 20th April 2025 to report  a persistent issue with the PDF preview feature in CKEditor.

The main problem was described as "the page breaks in the preview appear incorrect and sometimes the content was cut off, while pushing text to the next page an unstructured way". This significant anomaly has led to user complaints, as they often rely no the preview to check formatting before exporting the document into Word or PDF files. The exported PDF file was appeared to be fine, without any page break issues, which was confusing for the users who depend on an accurate preview.

Our team highlighted that this issue is not new, as it has occurred before and seemed to be resolved, but now it has resurfaced and  suggesting a recurring underlying problem. To assist the CKEditor support team in debugging the problem, we have also attached the supporting details and screenshots that illustrate the problem. We have also sought advice on three different key points, which was:
- Why the preview is not displaying the correct page breaks?
- Is there any settings or plugins that can be applied to ensure the preview is accurate?
- Whether this issue is known, and also if there is a patch/update is available?

Aldona Cupial-Wozniak, the Customer Engagement Coordinator from CKSource, responded and analyzed our feedback and following-up the problem onto us. After analysis, Aldona requesting clarification to our team to send us an example HTML content that causes this issuem so that they can investigate it and reproduce it locally on their end. Furthermore, she emphasized the importance of providing the editor version and full editor configuration stating that it will be very helpful if we can reproduce it.

On behalf of this issue, a follow-up request was created and Aldona reiterated her request for an example HTML content that they could use to reproduce this issue on their end. We responded to this follow-up, stating that we have attached a simplified version of the HTML content that should help reproduce the issue. We attached the whole GitHub repository of our program and also the "page_break.zip" feature that contains logic of pagination.

As of the last activity, the status of the follow-up ticket (#146064) remains "open", and the CKEditor Support Team is still in the process of gathering the necessary information to reproduce and diagnose the page break issue, and a definitive solution has not yet been offered.

# Inquiry Regarding Image Insert Behavior and Automatic Sizing

This ticket was opened by the Middleware Team, supposedly by Namirah Anwar, which initiated a support ticket at 21st March 2025 to report an issue with image insertion and resizing in CKEditor 5. The main problem is that when an image's width is set to 100%, does not always scale to 100% but instead follows the original image size. Similarly, setting it to 50% also retains the original proportions rather than applying the specified percentage.

Our team sought clarification on a way to configure CKEditor so that images automatically adjust based on the specified percentage rather than their original size, stating that this was an urgent matter for our users. Later, Justin Donoval, an Application Developer who also involved in the ticket, raised an additional related question that "When we upload image or copy pas image into editor, it automatically set into 75% or 50%, etc. insetead of default value" and asked for a solution to this.

Aldona Cupial-Wozniak, a Customer Engagement Coordinator from CKSource, initially responded by stating that they had not been able to reproduce this issue so far, and that the image should be automatically adjusted to the width of the editor. To further investigate, Aldona requested more information, specifically the full configuration of the editor, the version of the editor, detailed steps to reproduce the problem, whether any custom plugins were being used, and if the issue could be reproduced on their documentation demos. When our team posed her question about default automatic resizing upon upload/paste, Aldona confirmed that she would gather the feedback and get back to you.

Approximately two months after the initial request, Aldona provided the solution for automatically resizing images upon insertion. She advised that a "postfixer" could be registered to resize the image once it's inserted into the editor. She then provided a basic code implementation of a *ResizedImageAfterUpload* plugin. This plugin would use certain block of code to detect *imageBlock* insertions and then execute *editor.execute('resizeImage', {width: '50%'})* after a short timeout.

She also noted that this implementation might need some further adjustments based on your specific requirements. Aldona also provided links to relevant CKEditor 5 API documentation for *registerPostFixer*, *Differ*, *ResizeImageCommand*, and a tutorial for creating a simple plugin. Following this proposed solution, the request was marked as "Solved" and closed for comments.
